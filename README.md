# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns"
## Overview of the project
### Purpose
#### Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends in theater campaign success on Kickstarter. For the purpose of this project we will specifically be looking at campaign success based on launch date and target goal set.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis based on launch date
#### For the outcomes based on launch date i created a pivot table that filterd the data by parent category and date of launch. The coloumns display the outcome of the campaign and the rows display the month.Picture of pivot table below.

### Analysis based on goal outcomes
#### For this analysis I created a table sorted by campaign goals starting at less than $1,000 to $50,000 or more in increments of $5,000. Te table retrieved the number of successful, failed, and cancelled kickstater campaigns for each goal range. I then caluclated the precentage of successful and unsuccessful campaigns for each data range. An image of the table is shown below.

### Challenges and difficulties
#### I had some challenge displaying the numbers in the percentage successful and failed as actual percentages. The way I fixed was by simply changing the formating of my formula in percentage successful and failed categories and changing the cell properties from general to percentage.
## Results
### Outcomes based on launch date
#### From the results displayed on the line chart below we can we that May has been the most successful month to launch a campaign. We can also see that december is the month that has the lowest amount of successful campaigns launched. We can also see that the number of successful campaigns varies by month varies much more than the number of unsuccessful campaigns. This sugguests that the time a campaign is launched can help increase the chances of success but does not affect the chances of failure as much.

### Outcomes based on launch goal
#### These results are a little bit less clear but we can see that there is a trend of the campaigns with lower goals having a higher precentage of success, with the exception of range between $35,000 and $45,000. This sugguests that Louise may have higher success if she has a low kickstarter goal.

### Data limitations
#### The data set does not give us any indication of what the spotlight column is or how it has anything to do with the success of a campaign so that could be considered as a possible limitation.
### Other possible tables or graphs
#### We could have included a bar graph that shows the number of successful and unsuccessful campaigns based of category. This could help Louise see how successful theater campaigns are when compared to other types of kickstarter campaigns.
