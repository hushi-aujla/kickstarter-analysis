## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis based on launch date
#### For the outcomes based on launch date i created a pivot table that filterd the data by parent category and date of launch. The coloumns display the outcome of the campaign and the rows display the month.Picture of pivot table below.

### Analysis based on goal outcomes
#### For this analysis I created a table sorted by campaign goals starting at less than $1,000 to $50,000 or more in increments of $5,000. Te table retrieved the number of successful, failed, and cancelled kickstater campaigns for each goal range. I then caluclated the precentage of successful and unsuccessful campaigns for each data range. An image of the table is shown below.

### Challenges and difficulties
## Results
### Outcomes based on launch date
#### From the results displayed on the line chart below we can we that May has been the most successful month to launch a campaign. We can also see that december is the month that has the lowest amount of successful campaigns launched. We can also see that the number of successful campaigns varies by month varies much more than the number of unsuccessful campaigns. This sugguests that the time a campaign is launched can help increase the chances of success but does not affect the chances of failure as much.
