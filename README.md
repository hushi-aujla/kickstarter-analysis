## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis based on launch date
#### For the outcomes based on launch date i created a pivot table that filterd the data by parent category and date of launch. The coloumns display the outcome of the campaign and the rows display the month.Picture of pivot table below.![outcomes based on launch date](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99226892/155895964-57875f46-8d0b-4ed3-8cbd-1e7d9e5d9070.png)
### Analysis based on goal outcomes
#### For this analysis I created a table sorted by campaign goals starting at less than $1,000 to $50,000 or more in increments of $5,000. Te table retrieved the number of successful, failed, and cancelled kickstater campaigns for each goal range. I then caluclated the precentage of successful and unsuccessful campaigns for each data range. An image of the table is shown below.
